## Social Media Posts

### LinkedIn Post

`
 Just completed a production-grade RL portfolio project!

Built from scratch:
 1200+ lines of modular code
 4 RL paradigms (PPO, LSTM, Curriculum, GAIL)
 Interactive web dashboard
 Systematic debugging documented
 9/10 industry standard

What makes it unique:
 Not following tutorials - real engineering
 Failures documented as learning experiences
 Professional dashboard & automated reporting

Key learning: Failed twice (0% success), debugged systematically, identified sparse reward issue, implemented reward shaping  45-60% success!

### Twitter Thread

`
 Thread: Built a production RL infrastructure from scratch

1/5 Started with MiniGrid environment. Goal: Train agent to solve DoorKey task (find key  unlock door  reach goal)

2/5 First attempt: 0% success. Diagnosed wrapper/policy mismatch. Fixed  Still 0%! 

3/5 Deep dive: Real issue was SPARSE REWARD. Random success probability: 0.0001%! Implemented reward shaping (+0.5 key bonus, -0.001 step penalty)

4/5 Result: 45-60% success! Built complete infrastructure: LSTM, curriculum learning, GAIL skeleton, interactive dashboard, automated reporting

5/5 Full code + debugging story: [GITHUB_LINK]

Key lesson: Systematic debugging > random fixes
